        <p class="introduce">I am a graphic designer, currently study in Arnhem, NL(ArtEZ/2019~). With an interest in materialisation,
          I am focusing and practicing for how digitised images can blur the distinction between reality.
          It is inevitable that nowadays graphic designer should work with computerised environment. Based on this fact
          I am conscious of what is tactile experience from work which is mostly completed in untouchable and digitised place. </p>
