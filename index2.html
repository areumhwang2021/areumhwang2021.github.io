        <p class="introduce">I am a graphic designer, currently study in Arnhem, NL(ArtEZ/2019~). With an interest in materialisation, 
          I am focusing and practicing for how digitised material can blur the distinction between analogue and digital space. 
          It is inevitable that nowadays graphic designer has to deal with computerised environment. Based on this fact, I am striving to 
          comprehend what kind of experience I can obtain in each of these incompatible spaces and what effect it will have when the spaces 
          are inverted. Besides I am conscious of common ideas that society members have long created and followed. I express my feelings with 
          graphic design as a tool, questioning the tendency to force everyone to follow it, taking it for granted.</p>
